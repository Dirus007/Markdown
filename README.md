# Markdown Application

## Introduction
My Markdown Application is a Python tool that transforms Markdown text into formatted HTML tables or highlighted code snippets. It features a simple yet powerful Tkinter GUI for seamless operation, making Markdown conversions more accessible and efficient.

## Features
- **Code Mode**: Convert code snippets within Markdown to syntax-highlighted HTML.
- **Table Conversion**: Transform Markdown tables into HTML table format.
- **CSV Export**: Save converted tables as CSV files, ready for use in spreadsheets or data analysis tools.
- **Adjustable Settings**: Fine-tune the application's behavior through a customizable settings panel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x is recommended).
- Pip should be installed and available in your environment.

## Running the Application

## Usage
Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a GUI where you can input Markdown directly. The application offers two main functionalities:

After entering your Markdown text, click Run to perform the conversion.
